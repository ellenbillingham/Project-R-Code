# Project-R-Code
This repository contains all the R code I have written for my Project IV Mathematics report.

Each of the plots in my report has been produced using one of the files in this repository, as follows:

**Chapter 2** \
Figure 2.2: sir model in r.r \
Figure 2.3: fitting sir model to uk data.r \
Figure 2.5: sir model in r.r \
Figure 2.6: seir on uk data.r \
Figure 2.13: sitr fitting new.r 

**Chapter 3** \
Figure 3.1: 1d gp emulator with no hyperparameters.r \
Figure 3.2: bayes linear 1d emulator no hypers.r \
Figure 3.3: 1d gp emulator with scale hyperparameter tau.r \
Figure 3.4: 1d gp emulator with scale and nugget hyperparameters.r \
Figure 3.5: 1d gp emulator with scale nugget and lengthscale.r \
Figure 3.6: bayes linear 1d emulator with hypers.r 

**Chapter 4** \
Figure 4.1: 2d gp emulator with persp plot no hyperparameters.r \
Figure 4.2: 2d gp emulator with heat plots no hyperparameters.r 

**Chapter 5** \
Figure 5.1: sir model in r.r \
Figure 5.2: 1dgp max infections.r \
Figure 5.3: 1dgp time all hypers.r \
Figure 5.4: 1dgp log time all hypers.r \
